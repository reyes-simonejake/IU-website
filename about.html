          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>
            IU decided to become a singer when she was 14 after singing at her
            school's sports competition, as she felt happy receiving the
            audiences' applause. She started to attend auditions, but failed all
            20, and she was also scammed by fake entertainment companies. When
            IU was in her seventh grade, her family started to have financial
            problems due to the failure of her father's project. IU had to live
            apart from her parents in a studio room with her grandmother,
            younger brother, and cousin for a year and a half, in conditions of
            great poverty.

          <h3>2008–2010: Debut and Early Success</h3>
          <p>
            At 15, IU debuted with the EP Lost and Found in 2008. Her subsequent
            albums, Growing Up and IU...IM (2009), garnered mainstream
            attention. The 2010 single "Good Day" from the album Real propelled
            her to national stardom, topping South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart
            for five consecutive weeks. In 2019, "Good Day" was ranked number
            one on Billboard's "100 Greatest K-Pop Songs of the 2010s" list.

            third studio album, Modern Times (2013), marked a more mature
            musical style, with several tracks reaching the top 10 on the Gaon
            Digital Chart. The album was ranked number two on Billboard's "25
